# Website for POC of Mass Customization

![image](images/bg1-old2.jpg)

Project launched by a PhD student, with the aim of studying the performance of a production optimization algorithm for mass customization.
The website allows to check the efficiency of the algorithm and to collect the customers' opinion about the shoe configurator.

## About the project

What if tomorrow, we would stop making hundreds of products to stock? What if tomorrow, the customer could have a product that suits him, at an affordable price?

**Mass customization** is the offering of products or services that meet individual customer requirements, but that can still be efficiently mass produced (low cost at high scale). **Modular design** is one enabler of Mass Customization and consists of designing products composed by many independent components that can be combined in different ways.
Currently, the customization generally starts by customers choosing which components and options they desire in their product.
This process called product configuration is carried out through a **configurator**. This is a tool that allows the customer to change some product options.
Yet, Mass Customization has its limits. The high amount of choices proposed in Mass Customization can make the customers confused, because they do not always know how to translate their needs into product characteristics. Further, choosing unneeded features can lead to unnecessary high product prices.
In order to make Mass Customization more viable, with low costs and low complexity at customers' decision-process, the IPROD project was created.

## About IPROD

The main objective of the IPROD project is to offer mass-customized products that: 
1. Meet individual customer requirements and,
2. Are efficiently produced with the minimal overall manufacturing cost. 

Manufacturing costs include costs related to the product, i.e. raw material, and to the process, such as operations, material handling, machine configuration and layout design. Process planning ensures the translation of the product configuration data into a method to fabricate it. Currently, it is done separately from the product. Nevertheless, it is known that **manufacturing costs can highly affect product cost**. Due to that, IPROD proposes a methodology that **integrates the product configuration and process planning in modular systems** (i.e. modular product and processes). Further, in order to mass-customize products capable of **meeting individual customer requirements**, the IPROD methodology also proposes to implicate the customer and guide her/him during the product configuration. 

This is done through a configurator-quiz in which the customer is invited to answer a set of questions related to functionalities she/he desires in her/his product. Each functionality can be satisfied by one or more product components; therefore, an optimization takes place in order to find the optimal product configuration. This **optimization seeks to minimize the overall manufacturing cost**, which includes all costs aforementioned, while satisfying all functionalities required by the customer. Finally, the customer will be able to choose the product colors. If you still have not answered the quiz, we invite you to do it and let us know if our methodology is able to identify a product capable of meeting your needs. We would like to thank in advance for your contribution to our project
