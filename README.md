# Data-Science-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed for academic, self learning, and professional purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

## About me

Young Data Scientist just graduated from the University of Technology of Compiègne as a computer engineer specialized in data science and artificial intelligence.

Always looking for performance, improvement and new knowledge in the data environment, this portfolio gathers some projects on which I had the opportunity to think and work either in collaboration with other students or independently.

## Tools used

- *Visualisation*: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Ploty, Yellowbrick.
- *Machine Learning*: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost.
