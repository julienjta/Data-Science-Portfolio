In this project, I'm going to analyse and explore a dataset obtained from “Ease My Trip” website to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests in order to get meaningful information from it.

  > “Ease My Trip” is an internet platform for booking flight tickets, and hence a platform that potential passengers use to buy tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers.

The data will be used to make an accurate salary predictor to understand what influences prices.

## Research Questions

The aim of our study is to answer the below research questions:

- How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?
- Does price vary with Airlines?
- How is the price affected when tickets are bought in just 1 or 2 days before departure?
- Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?
- How does the price change with the in Source and the Destination?
- Does the number of stops influences the price?
- What variables influence most the price?

## Data collection and methodology

Octoparse scraping tool was used to extract data from the website. Data was collected in two parts: one for economy class tickets and another for business class tickets. A total of 300261 distinct flight booking options was extracted from the site. Data was collected for 50 days, from February 11th to March 31st, 2022. Data source was secondary data and was collected from Ease my trip website.
