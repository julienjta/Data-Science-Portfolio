    "\n",
    "In this project, I'm going to analyse and explore a dataset obtained from “Ease My Trip” website and to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests in order to get meaningful information from it. \n",
    "\n",
    ">  “Easemytrip“ is an internet platform for booking flight tickets, and hence a platform that potential passengers use to buy tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be used to make an accurate salary predictor but also to understand what influences prices.\n",

    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of our study is to answer the below research questions:\n",
    "- Does price vary with Airlines?\n",
    "- How is the price affected when tickets are bought in just 1 or 2 days before departure?\n",
    "- Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?\n",
    "- How the price changes with change in Source and Destination?\n",
    "- How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?"
