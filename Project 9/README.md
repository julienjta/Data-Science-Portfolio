## Aim of the project

The objective of this project is to develop from scratch an online payment and goods exchange management application within the university. 

## Features to add in the project

The database must allow:
- The management of the different users and administrators,
- The management of the different ads posted for the exchange of goods,
- The history of the different transactions made through the application,
- The management of bids on goods and exchanges in themselves.

## Technologies to be used

After writing the clarification note listing the different tables and their relationships, we can move on to the logical data model. This first step of conceptualization of the problem and collection of the needs will be followed by a step of implementation in SQL and then the realization of tests using Neo4J and MongoDB.
